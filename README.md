# Lead-Score-Case_Study
Building a logistic regression ML model to see which model can give the efficient results
X Education, a provider of online courses for professionals, is seeking assistance in identifying the leads with the highest potential for conversion into paying customers. They require a model that assigns a lead score to each potential customer. This score would indicate the likelihood of conversion, with a higher score suggesting a greater probability of conversion and a lower score indicating a lesser chance.
The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
